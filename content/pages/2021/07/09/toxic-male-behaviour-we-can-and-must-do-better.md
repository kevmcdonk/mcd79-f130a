title: Toxic male behaviour - we can and must do better
subtitle: >-
  I'm getting bored of some tweets. You know the ones. "Here's another
  unsolicited message". I'm bored of these because in 2021, these shouldn't be
  needed. The unsolicited DM should not be sent. End of story. People shouldn't
  have to share these Tweets, because we live in a world where we respect each
  other, especially women. But this isn't about everyone, this about how men
  treat women online.
