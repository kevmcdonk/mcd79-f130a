  Hiking is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult
  walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress
  requires pushing vegetation aside.

Three days into the announcements about Microsoft Viva and I have decided that it is time to tackle licensing. Yes, yes I am bonkers. The reason that I am having this discussion is that I want people to make an informed decision and balance the cost with the value while understanding how many licenses they may actually need.

From some discussions I have had, many people are switching off listening about the power of [Viva Topics](https://www.mcd79.com/2021/02/06/Knowledge-Management-Series-Introduction-to-Viva-Topics.html) and [SharePoint Syntex](https://www.mcd79.com/2020/09/26/Knowledge-Management-Series-Introduction-to-SharePoint-Syntex.html) when they hear that it requires a separate license. Some people may think that you need to pay this for everyone in the organisation and I will admit that an extra $10 approx per month per user for every single person in a multinational organisation would be quite a hit. So in this post, I will talk about the licensing required, who needs to have that licensing and how you could arrange things.

## How are SharePoint Syntex and Viva Topics licensed?

Both SharePoint Syntex and Viva Topics are licensed as add-ons so it does not matter whether you have E1, E3, E5, Business Premium etc, you will still need to pay for that add-on. Currently, they are $5 per user per month for each (or £3.80 for those in the UK). Once purchased, they must be assigned to each user. But which users require a license?

#### Who needs to see Topics?

For the Topics Experience, it is a fairly simple conversation. Anyone who requires to manage or even view Topics, either from the Topic Centre or as the Topics roll out wider within Microsoft 365, will require a license. To get the benefits of the shared knowledge across the organisation, it will mean an additional cost for each user. What happens if a license is removed?

So you can give access to the Topic Centre site but if no license is assigned then the user will just see a blank page.

#### Who needs licensing for Syntex?
