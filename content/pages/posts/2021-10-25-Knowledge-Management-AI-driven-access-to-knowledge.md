Have you heard about Project Cortex? The upcoming service from Microsoft that will help organisations to better manage their internal knowledge by using the best of breed content services such as SharePoint, OneDrive and Microsoft Search. Your current reaction probably sits in one of three places if you live in the Microsoft space:

- "I'm so excited" - you can't wait for Cortex and all the benefits it will bring to ease access to information.
- "It's going to be too expensive" - you might be excited about it or not but either way, you just don't think you'll get the budget to get anywhere with it.
- "Erm, what is Cortex?" it may be that you haven't heard about Cortex and the buzz that started at Ignite in 2019 - checkout [https://aka.ms/ProjectCortex](https://aka.ms/ProjectCortex) as a starter or listen to [our first GreyHatBeard show](https://www.greyhatbeard.com/2020-01-24-show2part2/).

Regardless of your current state of mind on Cortex, the aim of this series of posts is to get you thinking about knowledge in your environment. Where is it stored, how do your store it, formal/informal knowledge and how can you get access to that knowledge for the right people at the right time. Much of this will be made easier by Cortex but you can gain huge advantages by implementing some of these suggestions without Cortex and if you will be implementing Cortex later, then you will still need to
plan for many of these things.

## What exactly is Knowledge Management?

There is a lot of talk about Knowledge Management but what is meant by it? At its simplest level, it is about connecting those with knowledge with those that need the knowledge and preferably when they need that knowledge. Retaining information about key knowledge in a way that can be used by those that need it can be very simple (such as adding a note to a form that users fill in) or highly complex with a complex set of hierarchies driving intelligent access to knowledge from related systems.

This series of posts will help cover some of the areas to consider when setting up a Knowledge Management program although there is a lot more that would be needed which I will try and point you towards. To help this series to be practical as well as theoretical, I am going to demonstrate some of the practices using the Greybeard [etiquette of Microsoft 365](https://greyhatbeard.github.io/m365-etiquette/) content.

The posts will cover:
- Considering where knowledge is stored
- Organising knowledge
- Creating a culture of knowledge
- Records Management vs. Knowledge Management
- AI driven access to knowledge
- Searching and browsing through knowledge

Hopefully this will lead to your own knowledge to be better harvested and get people access to more information in easier ways. Naturally, a lot of the focus will be on Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft services but the logic applied can be used with other tools too - the process is the important part, not just the tools.
